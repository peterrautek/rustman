It doesn't take much - neither equipment nor preparation. 

All it takes is three friends and a commitment!

## Idea
The Rustman Challenge is a _triatlon relay_ - the distance of an _Ironman_. 
The catch is: You have one month to complete it as a team!

## Team
You need a team of three - one swimmer, one biker and one runner. Find some friends and motivate them to join your team.

## Distance
The team has to complete 
* 10 x 386 meters (0.24 miles) swimming
* 10 x 18.1 km (11.2 miles) biking
* 10 x 4.22 km (2.622 miles) running

## Order
Your team has to do the three disciplines in sequence. Each day your team has to finish at least one tenth of the distance. 
The order of the disciplines can be chosen by the team, but each discipline has to be completed before the next one starts.

For instance your team decides on the following (classical) order: swimming, biking, running. 
The swimmer has to start with 10 consecutive days of at least 386 meters (0.24 miles), 
the biker has to do the next 10 consecutive days of at least 18.1km (11.2 miles), 
and the runner finishes with 10 days of at least 4.22km (2.622miles) of running.

The commitment of each participant is 10 consecutive days of sport and 20 days of support for the teammates.

## Exceptions
There are no exceptions on race-days. Each race-day needs to be completed. 30 days in a row!
However, if one participant cannot complete one of her/his race-days, 
the other two teammates can choose to fill in. 
Which means that they both have to complete the day for their mate. 
They can do it together or individually but they must both do the full distance for this day.

That's all! As simple as that!

## Some more Advice
### Make it social! 
Meet with your teammates before the challenge starts and plan it out. 
Go for lunch/coffee/dinner in the transition days! 
Help each other out! Keep each other motivated! 
Create a Whatsapp group for your team. 
Share your run/bike/swim with your teammates!
### Tell others!
You can get support from your team but usually it also helps if you make a commitment and share it with others. 
Simply tell your friends and family. 
Maybe they join you on a race-day or cheer you up towards the end of your 10 days.
### Make it fun!
Yep - keep it fun! If one of your teammates drops out - don't quit your friendship. It's just a silly competition after all.
### Take it serious!
Although, compared to a triathlon the rustman challenge sounds easy - do not underestimate it!
Most people struggle to make time for sport. That's precisely the idea of the challenge:
Commit and support each other to complete 10 consecutive days of physical exercise.
If you don't feel fit enough to complete any of the race distances, better see a doctor and plan to do some serious lifestyle changes before you do anything else.

## FAQ
* Can I do it at the gym? <br>
Yes! Rustman is designed to easily fit your schedule and flexible with seasons! There are no rules about where and how you complete your race-days. If it's too hot or cold outside simply do it at the gym!

* Do all teammates have to be there on each race-day?<br>
No! Everyone completes their race-days individually. Just tell the others that you did it every day!

* Can someone join me on my run/bikeride/swim?<br>
Yes! Bring your teammates/friends/family with you on your race-days. Everything that helps you to get through the 10 consecutive race-days is allowed.

* Can we pause the race and resume after a day or two?<br>
No! This is the only requirement. It has to be 30 consecutive race-days for your relay! If you skip one day you are out. You need to plan your race together with your team.
